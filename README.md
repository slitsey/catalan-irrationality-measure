# Irrationality measures for Catalan's constant and differences of trigamma values

A Lean 4 formalization of sixteen irrationality measures. Let `G = ∑_{j ≥ 0} (−1)^j / (2j+1)^2` be
Catalan's constant, `L(2, χ₋₃) = ∑_{k ≥ 0} (1/(3k+1)^2 − 1/(3k+2)^2)` and `ψ′(x) = ∑_{n ≥ 0} 1/(n+x)^2`
the trigamma function, so that `ψ′(1) = ζ(2) = π²/6`. The irrationality exponent `μ(ξ)` of a real number
`ξ` is the infimum of the `μ` such that `|ξ − p/q| > q^(−μ)` for all integers `p` and all sufficiently
large integers `q`.

> **Theorem.**
>
> - μ(G) ≤ 532;
> - μ(G ± 5π²/48) ≤ 31.4411, for both signs;
> - μ(L(2, χ₋₃)) ≤ 13.7046;
> - μ(L(2, χ₋₃) ± π²/9) ≤ 9.5133, for both signs;
> - μ(ψ′(a/5) − π²/6) ≤ 23.9115 for a = 1, 2, 3, 4;
> - μ(ψ′(a/7) − π²/6) ≤ 2801 for a = 1, …, 6.

For `G` the Lean statement is `|G − a/b| > b^(−532)` for every integer `a` and every sufficiently large
integer `b`. For each of the other fifteen numbers `x`, with exponent `B`, it is: for every `e > 0` there
is `q₀` such that `|x − p/q| > q^(−(B+e))` for all coprime integers `p`, `q` with `q ≥ q₀`.

All proofs are kernel-checked in Lean and use only the axioms `propext`, `Quot.sound` and
`Classical.choice`.

Both papers build on OpenAI's proof that `G` is irrational ([openai/math](https://github.com/openai/math);
preprint dated September 24, 2026, released October 6, 2026), and the proof of μ(G) ≤ 532 also builds on
its Lean formalization. Other bounds in the literature:
- For `G`, R. K. Jha proved μ(G) ≤ 10^8 ([doi:10.5281/zenodo.23237269](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.23237269)).
  M. C. S. Carreira treated the five parameters of OpenAI's construction as free and obtained μ(G) < 2294
  ([doi:10.5281/zenodo.23532239](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.23532239)); H. S. Bojnal instantiated his
  general theorem at the design (36, 6, 2, 3, 2) to obtain μ(G) < 2401.74
  ([proof-factory/catalan-exponent](https://github.com/proof-factory/catalan-exponent)). R. Xu reported
  μ(G) ≤ 727.03 for the design (20, 3, 1, 2, 1), with a numerical certificate in ball arithmetic that is
  not formalized ([issue #5](https://github.com/slitsey/catalan-irrationality-measure/issues/5)).
- For `L(2, χ₋₃)` and its rational linear combinations with `ζ(2)`, Calegari, Dimitrov and Tang give
  24781 (arXiv:2510.04156, Theorem 5.1 and the remark after it).
- We know of no earlier irrationality result for `G ± 5π²/48`, `ψ′(a/5) − ζ(2)` or `ψ′(a/7) − ζ(2)`.

## Catalan's constant: μ(G) ≤ 532

OpenAI's proof compares, for a determinant whose entries are linear forms in `1` and `G`, a lower bound
coming from its denominators with an upper bound coming from an integral representation. The construction
depends on five integer parameters `(n₀, b₀, q₀, g₀, h₀)`, a *design*, and every argument here is carried
out for an arbitrary design. The design used is `(58, 9, 3, 5, 3)`: the determinant has size `58N`, and as
a polynomial in the constant it has degree at most `53N`.

- **Rank of the reduction modulo p.** At a prime `p` the denominator of the determinant is smaller by the
  dimension of the kernel of the reduction modulo `p` of the matrix of rational parts. Four closed
  formulas, proved for every design with antisymmetric row combinations, a reflection of Chebyshev
  polynomials modulo `p` and Frobenius relations, bound this dimension for `12N < p ≤ 26N`. Below `12N`
  further kernel vectors come from a single counting inequality for the nullity; on 34 windows of primes
  between `3N` and `16.2N` it is applied to fixed rational subspaces whose ranks are certified by stored
  integer kernel vectors. Together they give a piecewise linear profile with 102 pieces on
  `(16/7, 53/2]`, whose area, `22.05972…` in units of `N²`, is the gain in the denominators.
- **Real place.** A Gauss quadrature formula with `53N` nodes and an identity of Andréief type with fixed
  points bound the determinant on the neighbourhood `|x − G| ≤ e^(−ρN)`, `ρ = 301.54258…`. The energy
  estimate uses trial sequences with 160 Chebyshev coefficients and 75 geometric terms, 41 of them
  complex (logarithmic potentials of point charges near the edges of the support of the extremal
  measure), checked on covers of 373, 302 and 176 cells with an exact local Taylor expansion.
- **Criterion.** For large `N` the integer polynomials obtained by clearing denominators are at most
  `e^(−ηN²)` on that neighbourhood, with `η = 30.041`. A criterion with a free lower end of the window of primes, which
  uses the largest prime of the window whose square does not divide `b`, gives `|G − a/b| > b^(−532)`:
  its last condition reads `532 > dρ/(η − 4dδ) = 531.99924…` with `d = 53` and `δ = 2.9·10⁻⁷`. The prime
  number theorem enters through the denominators and the choice of the prime.

In Lean, `CatalanMeasure/GenD/` is the design-generic layer: the denominators, the closed formulas
(`t_rank`, `u_rank`, `u6_rank_closed`, `s_rank`), the nonvanishing, the real place (`Analytic/`, `Cert/`)
and the criterion, assembled by `CatalanMeasure.GenD.measure_of_design` from a `DesignData` record.
`GenD/Uniform/W/` contains the counting inequality (`w_core`), its form for fixed rational subspaces
(`Charts3.host_count`) and the decision procedure for the window conditions (`Charts6.Check.checkHost`,
with soundness `physHost_of_checks`). `GenD/Uniform/Bank532/` holds the list `wins532` of the 102
intervals, the bound `gain532_ge` for their area, the data of the 34 windows and the final assembly, and
`GenD/D58/` instantiates the design at the real place and for the denominators. The generic valuation
theorems of the construction are in `CatalanMeasure/Parametric/`. The theorem is
`CatalanMeasure.GenD.Uniform.Bank532.catalan_irrationalityMeasure_532` in
[`Hosts532Inst.lean`](CatalanMeasure/GenD/Uniform/Bank532/Hosts532Inst.lean).

## Differences of trigamma values

For `0 < s < t ≤ 1` put `Ψ(s, t) = ψ′(s) − ψ′(t)`. The other fifteen numbers are, up to rational affine
maps (which do not change `μ`), values of `Ψ`:

```text
Ψ(1/4, 1) = 8 (G + 5π²/48),              Ψ(3/4, 1) = −8 (G − 5π²/48),
Ψ(1/3, 1) = (9/2) (L(2, χ₋₃) + π²/9),    Ψ(2/3, 1) = −(9/2) (L(2, χ₋₃) − π²/9),
Ψ(1/3, 2/3) = 9 L(2, χ₋₃),               Ψ(a/q, 1) = ψ′(a/q) − ζ(2).
```

The approximations are determinants of rectangular Löwner matrices of a digamma difference
`ψ(z+1) − ψ(z+s)` (for `L(2, χ₋₃)`, a combination of three digamma functions) at integer nodes: a common
block of `r` nodes, which carries the variable, and an interleaved border of about `cr/2` row nodes and
`cr/2` column nodes, where `c` is the only parameter of the geometry. Three estimates are proved once, for
every shift.

- **Content.** As in the arithmetic method of Rhin and Viola, the `p`-adic valuation of the common
  denominator is bounded prime by prime, by a finite list of local bounds: assignment problems with
  explicit potentials, the rank of the reduction modulo `p` of a rescaled matrix, and windows of the
  border free of poles, where the reduction is translation invariant (for the small primes, which meet
  the border several times, the windows are read modulo `p`). Each is an explicit integer expression in
  the scale, the border, the prime and the first poles of the frame modulo `p`. One theorem turns a
  finite table of affine pieces, checked by comparisons of rational numbers, into the bound
  `(Λ + o(1)) r²` for the logarithm of the denominator, using the prime number theorem in arithmetic
  progressions; the same table serves every shift with the same denominator `q`.
- **Nonvanishing.** By Hermite interpolation in characteristic zero, after deleting a bounded number of
  common nodes (at most 64), some member of the family is nonzero at any given rational point. No prime
  is involved.
- **Decay.** Andréief's identity for the row and column nodes, with Cauchy determinants, reduces the size
  of the determinant to a discrete logarithmic energy. A lower bound for this energy comes from a
  comparison measure on finitely many segments, through the conditional positive definiteness of the
  logarithmic kernel, and is verified on a finite cover by cells in exact rational arithmetic. The result
  is `|P(x)| ≤ e^(−(D − o(1)) r²)` for `|x − ξ| ≤ e^(−γr)`.

Together they give `μ ≤ γ/(D − Λ)`:

| number | (s, t) | c | Λ | D | γ | γ/(D − Λ) | B |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| G ± 5π²/48 | (1/4, 1), (3/4, 1) | 1/5 | 3.5160256 | 3.7447213 | 7.1904273 | 31.44102 | 31.4411 |
| L(2, χ₋₃) | (1/3, 2/3) | 1/2 | 4.0959278 | 4.6435117 | 7.5043742 | 13.70452 | 13.7046 |
| L(2, χ₋₃) ± π²/9 | (1/3, 1), (2/3, 1) | 3/10 | 3.3114645 | 4.0291249 | 6.8272548 | 9.513211 | 9.5133 |
| ψ′(a/5) − π²/6 | (a/5, 1) | 2/9 | 3.5139083 | 3.8135797 | 7.1655663 | 23.91141 | 23.9115 |
| ψ′(a/7) − π²/6 | (a/7, 1) | 1/6 | 3.6398277162 | 3.6424792669 | 7.4259546075 | 2800.609 | 2801 |

Here `Λ` is the content constant, `D` the decay constant and `γ` the window constant. They are the
rational numbers of the formal proof, rounded outward (`Λ` and `γ` up, `D` down); the column
`γ/(D − Λ)` is the exact quotient, rounded up. The shift `s = 1/2`, with `Ψ(1/2, 1) = π²/3`, belongs to
the same family, but the exponent the method gives for it is larger than the known bounds for `μ(ζ(2))`,
so it is not stated.

The shared results are in `CatalanCore/Uniform/` (namespace `CatalanCore.Uniform`): the content theorem
`Content.BankShared.Check.hasScaledContent_of_check`, and its form for frames with several first poles,
`Content.BankShared.KTerm.hasScaledContent_of_kcheck`; the rank bound
`Content.BankShared.TwoTerm.LP2HypW.gle` and the window bound
`Content.BankShared.TwoTerm.Pre.prefix_gle`; the selection theorem `BlockGeom.hasNV0`; the decay theorem
`Decay.AltDecay.altGeom_hasScaledDecay`; and the deduction `measure_of_family_nv0_even`. They also use
modules from the rest of `CatalanCore/` and from `CatalanFrames/` and `CatalanLambda/` (among them the
frames, Cauchy determinants and Andréief's identity). The data of each family are in
`CatalanCore/Uniform/Bank/`.

### G ± 5π²/48

The shifts `1/4` and `3/4`, with `ψ′(1/4) = π² + 8G` and `ψ′(3/4) = π² − 8G`. The two shifts exchange the
two classes of primes modulo 4, so they have the same content constant, and one decay certificate serves
both. The frame, the decay cover and the nonvanishing are in `Bank/Fourths/`, the content table in
`Bank/FourthsContent/`. The theorem is `CatalanCore.Uniform.Bank.FourthsContent.Bound.lambda_measure`,
whose Boolean argument selects the sign; the public theorems are `TrigammaDifferences.lambda_minus_measure`
and `TrigammaDifferences.lambda_plus_measure` (the names refer to `λ± = G/2 ± 5π²/96`, so that
`G ± 5π²/48 = 2λ±`).

### L(2, χ₋₃)

The frame is `−⅓ ψ(z + ⅓) + ½ ψ(z + ½) − ⅙ ψ(z + 1)`, with `c = 1/2`. It has three digamma terms, so the
local bounds at a prime `p` involve two first poles; on each class of primes modulo 6 both are affine in
one index, and the content theorem applies with `q` replaced by 6. The content constant is
`Λ = 4.09592776731…`, and `γ/(D − Λ) = 13.704516… < 13.7046`. The content is in `Bank/Chi3/KContent/`
(`chi3_k_content`), the decay in `Bank/Chi3New/` (`chi3_decay`) with its cover in `Bank/Chi3/Cover/`, and
the theorem is `CatalanCore.Uniform.Bank.Chi3.KContent.chi3_measure_L2_k`; the public theorem is
`TrigammaDifferences.chi3_measure`.

### L(2, χ₋₃) ± π²/9

The shifts `1/3` and `2/3`: with `L = L(2, χ₋₃)`, `ψ′(1/3) = 2π²/3 + 9L/2` and `ψ′(2/3) = 2π²/3 − 9L/2`.
The content table uses the primes in the classes modulo 6. The data are in `Bank/Thirds/` and
`Bank/ThirdsContent/`; the theorems are `CatalanCore.Uniform.Bank.ThirdsContent.Bound.thirds_plus_measure`
and `thirds_minus_measure`, and the public theorems `TrigammaDifferences.chi3_plus_pi2_measure` and
`TrigammaDifferences.chi3_minus_pi2_measure`.

### ψ′(a/5) − π²/6

For `1 ≤ a ≤ 4`, `ψ′(a/5) − ζ(2)` is a rational linear combination of the values `L(2, χ)` for the
Dirichlet characters `χ` modulo 5. The four shifts share one content table, indexed by the four root
classes of the primes, and one decay certificate. The data are in `Bank/Fifths/` and
`Bank/FifthsContent/`; the theorems are `CatalanCore.Uniform.Bank.FifthsContent.Bound.fifths1_measure`,
…, `fifths4_measure`, and the public theorems `TrigammaDifferences.fifths1_measure`, …,
`TrigammaDifferences.fifths4_measure`.

### ψ′(a/7) − π²/6

For `1 ≤ a ≤ 6`, likewise a combination of the values `L(2, χ)`, `χ` modulo 7, and of `π²`, with six root
classes. Here `D − Λ` is about `2.7·10⁻³`, and the exponent is correspondingly large. The data are in
`Bank/Sevenths/` and `Bank/SeventhsContent/`; the theorem is
`CatalanCore.Uniform.Bank.SeventhsContent.Bound.sevenths_measure`, whose argument is `a − 1` in `Fin 6`,
and the public theorems are `TrigammaDifferences.sevenths1_measure`, …,
`TrigammaDifferences.sevenths6_measure`.

## Kernel-checked certificates

All numerical bounds are ordinary kernel-checked rational and integer computations (`decide +kernel`;
no `native_decide`): for `G`, the inverses and residue tables modulo 1009, the trial sequences, the cell
covers and the stored kernel vectors; for the trigamma differences, the content tables and the cell
covers of the decay certificates. The certificate data were computed with floating-point optimisation and
interval arithmetic (Arb), which are not trusted: Lean rechecks every inequality.
Large certificates are split into many small declarations with explicit intermediate values, chained by
general lemmas, and integer recurrences whose values are divisible by large powers of 2, such as the
Chebyshev and Clenshaw recurrences, are checked on the quotients by those powers. The scripts that
generated the data are in [`scripts/`](scripts/); the authoritative proof data are the Lean source
literals.

## Vendored code

Palomar requires Lean v4.35.0-rc2 or later, and every imported file must use Lean's module
system. OpenAI's repository is pinned to Lean v4.34.1 and does not use modules, so 479 files of
OpenAI's formalization (from commit `fd4aeeb2ee4fc729c18d98444fed42fd0529eeeb` of
[openai/math](https://github.com/openai/math)) and the 10 files that OpenAI adds to
PrimeNumberTheoremAnd are copied into `OAI/` and `PrimeNumberTheoremAnd/`. Each was converted to a
module and adjusted for the newer Lean and Mathlib (see [`PORTING.md`](PORTING.md)). The proof of
μ(G) ≤ 532 imports 386 of the files in `OAI/` and all 10 in `PrimeNumberTheoremAnd/`; the proofs for the
trigamma differences import no file of `OAI/` and, for the Wiener–Ikehara theorem, 9 of the files in
`PrimeNumberTheoremAnd/`. In 37 point-evaluation files of OpenAI's certificate, which the theorems above do not import,
the comparison constants are given to seven digits (the computations are unchanged; see `NOTICE`).
Licences and attributions are in [`NOTICE`](NOTICE); all of this code is under the Apache License 2.0.

The directory `archive/` holds Lean modules that the theorems above do not import. It is not part of
the default build and is not used by any proof above.

## Building and checking

You need [elan](https://github.com/leanprover/elan) and several GiB of free disk.

```text
lake exe cache get
python3 scripts/check-lean-sources.py
lake build
ruby scripts/validate-formalization.rb
ruby scripts/validate-formalization.rb formalization-hybrid.yaml
./scripts/verify-comparator.sh
```

`lake build` builds both solution files. The numerical checks can use several GiB per Lean process; use
a small worker count (for example `LEAN_NUM_THREADS=2`) on memory-constrained machines. The comparator
script checks `comparator.json`; it needs Linux and `bwrap` (bubblewrap).

## Authorship and use of AI

The mathematics, the Lean formalization, the certificate generators and the text were produced by AI systems at the request of the author, who posed the problems, directed the work and is responsible for it: Claude Opus 5.5, Claude Sonnet 5.5 and Claude Haiku 5.5 (Anthropic), running in Claude Code, and GPT-6.1 Sol (OpenAI), running in Codex. The underlying irrationality proof for G and its Lean formalization are OpenAI's, as is the vendored code described above.
